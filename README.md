# Slot Machine Game

A simple, terminal-based slot machine game written in Python. This project is a great example of a basic interactive program that handles user input, game logic, and a dynamic console-based UI.

## **Features**

* **Interactive Gameplay:** The game guides the player through depositing money, choosing betting lines, and placing bets.
* **Dynamic UI:** A basic spinning animation is displayed in the terminal before the final slot combination appears.
* **Robust Game Logic:** The program accurately calculates winnings based on symbol values and checks for winning combinations across multiple lines.
* **Persistent Balance:** The player's balance is updated after each spin, allowing for continuous play until they run out of funds or choose to quit.
* **Input Validation:** The code includes validation to ensure that users enter valid numeric input for deposits, bets, and lines.
